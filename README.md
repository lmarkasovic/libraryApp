# LibraryApp

ASP.NET CORE MVC Web app which displays list view of library books that user can browse and borrow. App uses Entity Framework in-memory database and loads data from XML.


**The assignment was:**  

Using a sample XML datasource, create a list view that allows a user to browse and borrow books. Books that have been borrowed should display who has borrowed them and prevent others from also borrowing the book until it has been returned.
The XML should be loaded and mapped into Objects, with all operations being handled in memory.  

Requirements:
 - Use C#
 - Use MVC as UI pattern
 - CSS & JS won't be evaluated
 - No need to create or use SQL database, in-memory handling is enough
 - No need to set up auth/authorize
 - Make IOC part of solution
 - Write few unit test 
 - Make the code maintanable, extendable and reusable
